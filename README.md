## Hi there / ä½ å¥½ ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning as an undergraduate at SUSTech in China.

In high school I participated in olympiad in informatics, and had some experience with coding.

I got a silver from NOI 2022. I also tried to modify an existing online judge system to deploy it in our campus.

In university I participated in ICPC World Finals 2025 and due to some bad luck we only got Honors.

Now I'm trying to learn some deep learning and eventually, do something new.
