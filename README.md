## Hi there / 你好 👋

I'm currently learning as an undergraduate at SUSTech in China.

I'm trying to learn some deep learning. I wish I could do some related research in the future.

In case people here might happen to know me by my experiences in competitive programming:

- In high school I participated in olympiad in informatics, and started to have some experience with coding. I went to the national finals, it was fun.
- In university I took part in ICPC and advanced to the finals, but unfortunately we played bad and just got Honors.
